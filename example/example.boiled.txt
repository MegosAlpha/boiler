I am in example.txt.
1) Install boiler.
2) Type boil metaboil and run boiler with crab.boil and helloalert.boil in the directory. You get:
I am metaboil.boil.
When example.txt gets boiled, I get boiled, then boil crab and boil helloalert. Then crab and helloalert
get interpolated into me. I then get interpolated back into example.txt.
You will need:
1 crab

Step 1: Eat it.
// I have issues with .boil, so I am taking the easy way out as an irregular module.
alert('Hello world!');
#boil metaboil BAD IDEA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3) Profit!
